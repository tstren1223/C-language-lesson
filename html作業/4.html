	<p></p><b>&#9829 My experience in the last Wake Up Festival&#9829     <p></p>Actually,My experience in the tenth Wake Up festival is terrible,but
	I have to say it is a big pity that this theth festival is the last time for the organizors. During the whole activity,I did enjoy a lot of music
	and know more about the singers or the bands I hadn't known before.Howerver,the site this even was held was a such terrible space.
	For example, a lot of fans would jump within the festival. Then, a large area of grass would die. So,soonly,fans andI all stood upon the mud.
	That's why we all felt as if we had been farmers in this festival. Besides, the queue for items about this festival wasn't controlled well.
	Thus, amlost every one wanting its merchandise needed to waste a quite large amount of time! What a shame!
	I think one of the only two good thing in this festival is to hear many songs simultaneously. Another one is I can have more mutual memories with my friend.
	Finally,this festival will not be held any more and this thenth festival really sucks for me. I hope I can join a more fancy festival someday.
