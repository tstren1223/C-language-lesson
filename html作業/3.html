Life usually is like a mess of shit. I may face a very painful time for break-up or I may encounter some changes in my ordinary life,such as someone leaving or someone coming in my life.Then,watching views can help me to calm down and get back my peace for life. Althogh food and cute things can heal me a lot,to have a strongger mind from views will help me for longer time. That's why I put this favorite thing in the last place. It is something important but also usually ignored.</div>
